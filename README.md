# Approach
#### I started with creating four parent div's that had four children div's to create a 4x4 board with a total of 16 cards. I added a click call-back function within the individual div's to be able to identify what "card" was being selected. I also add a timeout function to the flipped cards that don't match, so after 1sec they go back to their original state. If the cards matched they became none-functional. I wanted to make a function that would shuffle the array, but I really struggled with it and in order to get "random" layout of cards I moved the div's around in the HTML. 

## Technology
1. HTML
2. CSS

## Things to revisit
1. Create a place for others to comment on my blog.
2. Add an image upload feature
3. Figure out how to place the newest post on top of the page instead at the bottom.
4. Get my app posted on Heroku


## Personal & Challenges
### I learned a few things about myself when working on this project.
1. Attention to detail continues to be something I keep having issues with. Going into this project I already knew where I needed to improve and I was able to catch some of my errors.
2. Bootstrap is
3. Stick to my original ideas. When I first started working on my project I started with images inside of divs. After running into a few roadblocks, I scrapped my whole project and started from scratch. If I would of worked through the original problems I would of been more satisfied with what I've completed.
