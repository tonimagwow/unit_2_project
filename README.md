# Approach
#### My original idea was to create a blog about rugby and my long life friendships that I've made playing it, but then my idea changed and I wanted to make it about traveling and how much I love it. Then I realized I want to create a blog about things that I have a passion for, and that's how Antonio's Super Cool Blog Spot was born.

## Technology
1. HTML
2. CSS

## Things to revisit
1. Create a place for others to comment on my blog.
2. Add an image upload feature
3. Figure out how to place the newest post on top of the page instead at the bottom.
4. Get my app posted on Heroku


## Personal & Challenges
### I learned a few things about myself when working on this project.
1. Attention to detail continues to be something I keep having issues with. Going into this project I already knew where I needed to improve and I was able to catch some of my errors.
2. Bootstrap can make things look really nice really quick (insert sarcasm). Before I knew it I was three hours in and I was still only half way through styling my Index page. I really did enjoy working with it and I'm looking forward to getting further into it.
